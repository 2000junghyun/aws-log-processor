# S3 Access Log Merger & CSV Converter

## Problem

- S3 access log files are generated at fixed intervals that may not align with user needs.
- Users often require dynamic merging of logs based on custom time ranges.
- Each file is in `.txt` format, which is not ideal for readability or data processing.
- Conversion to `.csv` is necessary for better usability.

## Solution

- The script merges all log files within a date-specific folder.
- Logs can be reviewed by date, and the merging logic can be easily adjusted for different time intervals.
- Files are converted from `.txt` to `.csv` format.
- If a file has no extension, `.txt` is added by default.
- The contents of individual `.txt` files are consolidated into a single `.csv` output file.
